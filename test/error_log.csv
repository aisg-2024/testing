Subject: Sample Data Request
Body: Chris,

We have contacted Pat Priestley regarding obtaining the following data for the ISO audit.

We requested two sets of data.  One set which includes daily detail source data from a sample of meters before the application of distribution loss factors and load profiles, and a second set which includes the daily detail meter data that is summed within the SQMD file.  

For each UDC we requested data from 2 meters from each rate class (1 actual meter and 1 estimated meter).  In addition we requested 5 Enron meters from each UDC from different rate classes. The meter data should be taken from 2/15/00, 6/11/00, 7/15/00, 8/7/00, 12/28/00, respectively.

Pat has notified us that a WIP is required in order for us to obtain this data, please confirm if this is the case.

Regards,

Ken

Mark -- I am working with the East power desk to purchase space for an EnronOnline banner ad on a PJM website.  We are buying 7 ads at 500/month/ad for 3 months ($10,500 total).  They are running this ad as a pilot program offered for only 3 months.  I am attaching the agreement they sent to us.  I would like to revise section 2.01 to state that EnronOnline has first right of refusal to keep the ad on their site if they extend the program after three months.  Could you help me revise this agreement?

Thanks

Subject: Entergy -- credits for network upgrades  (ER01-2021 and ER01-2106)
Body: Last week FERC issued an order conditionally accepting two interconnection and operating agreements:  1) Entergy Louisiana and Washington Parish and 2) Entergy Arkansas and GenPower Keo.   The Commission ordered Entergy to revise the credit provision in the agreements (and in Entergy's pro forma IA in its OATT) to provide for crediting of all network upgrades.  This is consistent with a May 2001 FERC order that required Consumers Energy to credit customers for all network upgrade costs, including those incurred to remedy short-circuit or stability related problems.

Subject:



        There were more developments the past few days in the syncoal area

that might interest you.

        As you know, the IRS plans to write the ""capacity"" of each syncoal

plant into any private letters rulings it issues in the future.  Plant

owners will be held to production at this level.

        I spoke to Joe Makurath this morning about a rumor that he plans to

hold one project that is seeking a ruling to a ""capacity"" of 198,000 tons a

year.  Makurath is the IRS branch chief for section 29 rulings.  The ""rumor""

was actually a report by a tax lawyer for Detroit Edison that the IRS looked

at actual output at his client's plant in 1998 and derived the ""capacity"" of

the plant from this output.  The tax lawyer complained, but was told he

could ""lump it.""

        Makurath said the following:

        1. He has made no final decision about how to determine capacity.

        2. The IRS has issued only one ruling since the rulings window

reopened in April.  That was a ruling to someone who already had a ruling,

but who had merely changed the entity that owns the project.  The new ruling

does not specify the capacity of the project.  That's because there was no

change in process from when the earlier ruling was issued.  He regards a

change in feedstock as a change in process.

        3. The ""capacity"" will be the capacity of the facility when it went

into service in June 1998.

        4. He is still feeling his way on how to determine the capacity when

the facility went into service.  Actual output is merely an ""interesting

fact.""  Capacity is not the same thing as output.  Some people made

representations about capacity at the time.  It would be ""strange"" if a

facility that people thought was capable of producing ""100 units in June

1998 is now able to produce 1,000 units.""  That might call into question

whether the facility was in service in June 1998 because it was just

starting to ramp up.  (An old revenue ruling holds that a power plant was in

service when it was producing at 17% of capacity and ramping up steadily

from there.)

        There was another rumor today that the IRS has backed off somewhat

in the Detroit Edison case.  The taxpayer is hoping it can get a capacity of

two times nameplate.  The coalition of syncoal owners is gearing back up to

lobby Congress for help.

Keith

	List of accomplishments for Rob Benson

	1. Made a fast and profitable transition from cash cinergy trader to term PJM trader.
	2. Current P/L is over $67,000,000, budget for the year was set at $15,000,000.
	3. No losing months, worst month was positive $2,700,000.
	4. Very high return on VAR, don't have actual numbers ( sorry ).
	5. Done two customer load following deals, both have turned out to be very profitable.
	6. Exceeded all EOL goals, both number of trades and volume. Each month I'm in the top 3 in east power for number of trades and volume.
	7. Have always stayed within my VAR limits
	8. I have become the market for all PJM trades, both on and off peak.
	9. My P/L has come from intra-day trading as well as an underlying fundamental position in both on and off peak. P/L did not come from just one big move.
	10. Have always put on positions based on my fundamental view, even if that view differed from others on the desk.
