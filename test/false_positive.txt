I know you asked if we could have a button to clear the build route data, so as to start from scratch.  I haven't forgotten... just haven't had a chance to implement it.

Subject: Alaskan Info
Body: Note:  I had been sending the Arctic market intelligence to John Goodpasture.   Is your group primary on the project now, or do I continue to send to someone else?  Let me know.  
Arctic Resources Gains Key Aboriginal Support for Northern Pipe 
Arctic Resources Co., the upstart that only last year entered the myriad of pipeline proposals to move northern gas into the Lower 48, moved a few steps closer to fulfilling its dream of building a pipeline from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay to Edmonton, AB, last week by earning the endorsement of key Canadian aboriginal leaders. 
The cornerstone of ARC's approach is to build a consortium of political, producer, transportation and regional leaders; without aboriginal support, the plan would never succeed. However, Bob Murphy, point man for Houston-based ARC, said Friday that if all continues to go well, "gas could be flowing by 2006." 
Last week, aboriginal leaders representing the Sahtu landowners and the Alberta First Nations agreed to endorse the project, including its approach to providing pipeline management by aboriginal and Native American groups involved in the governance of the project.  The Deh Cho, said Murphy, who also occupy a significant portion of the land through which a pipeline will travel, are now considering the proposal, and Murphy said he was optimistic. 
"Together, Sahtu and Deh Cho lands represent over 70% of the land in the Northwest Territories, through which a pipeline would travel," he said. Gaining aboriginal support is key to any pipeline to the Lower 48, he said. 
ARC's Northern Gas Pipeline Project would create a natural gas pipeline extending from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska through and under the Beaufort Sea, coming onshore in northern Canada and extending through the Mackenzie River Valley to interconnects in Edmonton. Following a ramp-up period, ARC estimates it would transport 4 Bcf/d through the high-pressure 1,200 mile, fully entrenched route. 
The pipeline would cost $4 billion, and financing and reserves would add another $1 billion to the cost, which would be 100% debt financed. The debt financing would lower the tariffs, making it attractive to shippers, promoters say. Murphy said he's hopeful that by the end of the year, ARC could begin its pre-application permitting process, but he added there was still much to be accomplished. 
"The ARC approach is all inclusive," Murphy told NGI. "We fully intend to gain the support of all of the parties because we are offering a balanced approach to project management. We believe our approach is far more than just a route. That's important to understand. Our approach offers the least expensive, the lowest tariff," he said. "Politically, we have to take care of Canadian interests. We have to take care of the political issues in Canada, and that includes bringing the aboriginal regions in. You have to do that to succeed." 
ARC's proactive approach combines Canadian aboriginal and Native American interests that line the pipeline route with an independent business consortium under the company's umbrella, Murphy said. The balance of interests of the competing stakeholders offers the type of business discipline "that will be required by the capital markets and industry." 
What ARC gained last week was a Framework Memorandum, executed by the Ernie MacDonald Land Corp. (EMLC), one of six Sahtu landowners whose territory would be crossed by the pipeline. The memorandum was structured to include participation of other aboriginal landowners following briefings in their communities. The Fort Norman Metis Land Corp. also agreed to join EMLC as a signatory to the memorandum. 
EMLC President Larry Tourangeau said that he believed the "interests of Canada, the United States, industry, the environment and aboriginal people are best served by an initial single, cost-effective pipeline that connects both northern Canada and Alaska to southern markets without damaging either Canadian or Alaskan resources." 
What EMLC also likes, and what Murphy hopes ARC can convince other aboriginal leaders of as well, is that ARC will give the affected aboriginal regions control over the pipeline --- an approach not used by other competing proposals. "We believe that aboriginal ownership and involvement, as proposed in the ARC approach, will improve the prospects for a safe, timely and economic project," said Tourangeau. 
ARC Chairman Forrest Hoglund, who spearheaded the efforts of former Exxon Corp. in its unfulfilled plans to build a natural gas pipeline from Alaska almost 30 years ago, said the endorsement of aboriginal leaders "marks a major milestone to getting to the right answer quickly on this important project." He called the "one pipeline approach with aboriginal support" the "fastest, lowest cost, best environmental and best political approach" for the region. 
Now it's on to gaining more support, and beginning the critical step of establishing a special purpose committee, Murphy said. The SPC would be organized and created under Canadian law and owned by certain aboriginal groups whose lands the pipeline crosses. Similar provisions would be offered for the Alaskan region, he said. 
Murphy said ARC is now working with the producers interested in an Alaskan pipeline, as well as political leaders in Canada and Washington, DC. When asked how producer involvement was going, Murphy said the companies were "doing the type of work anyone would need to do" to study which option would be best for their companies. 
"At the same time, we're certainly hopeful that they're going to want to perceive this route as the far more economical one and the one with the best political approach," Murphy said. "Of course, the economics of the project matter, but politics matter too. Pipelines have to work economically and not just at $9 gas. This is a long-term project, and we've put a great deal of emphasis on the business sense of it." 
ARC's proposal is not the only one on the drawing board, but so far, none have gotten further than the proposal stage. No applications have been applied for yet by any of the competing proposals, which include two other major proposals: 
The Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS): The ANGTS was approved in September 1977 by President Jimmy Carter and the U.S. Congress. The proposal envisions a 5,000-mile joint U.S.-Canadian overland pipeline that would deliver up to 2.5 Bcf/d to the Lower 48. Portions of ANGTS already have been completed, with more than 2,600 miles along two legs from Alberta into the United States. The statutory framework between Canada and the United States also still exists. However, this project has languished and environmental reviews still have not been completed. Costs for the unbuilt segments range between $7-$11 billion. 
The Central Pipeline Route would follow the ANGTS to just below the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, then travel southeast through the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge into the Northwest Territories and south into the Mackenzie River Valley into Alberta. This has languished mostly because of environmental protests of the route and less political support.

Patrick,

While reviewing the proposed easement I found myself
making many changes to the easement.  It then occurred
to me that Ann Elizabeth has already prepared a standard
easement for situation where another company wishes
to construct a new pipeline across HPL owned property.

Perhaps you can use this standard easement agreement
(attached hereto) for the situation in Assumption Parish?

Let me know your thoughts on this agreement.  It's terms
and conditions are certainly more favorable to Enron's interests.

Mark -- I am working with the East power desk to purchase space for an EnronOnline banner ad on a PJM website.  We are buying 7 ads at 500/month/ad for 3 months ($10,500 total).  They are running this ad as a pilot program offered for only 3 months.  I am attaching the agreement they sent to us.  I would like to revise section 2.01 to state that EnronOnline has first right of refusal to keep the ad on their site if they extend the program after three months.  Could you help me revise this agreement?

Clarissa - Thanks so much for all your help with this pipe!  Everything looks great.  I just have a couple of paths
that I need to finish it:

January 2000 - I need deal #854688 pathed for EPGT and for TETC.  According to the invoice, we should have
                      11,129 dth on the interconnect.

February 2000 - I need deal #871184 pathed for HPL and CHAN.  HPL should have 3,600 dth and CHAN should
                       have 11,500 dth on the interconnect.

July 2000 - Deal #871172 has an interconnect issue.  According to MOPS contract #105124, they received 8,275 dth
                 on the Matagorda 624, but according to EPGT, they delivered 10,362 dth to HPL (?)  Could this possibly
                 need to be split somehow, or do you have any other ideas?

Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

        There were more developments the past few days in the syncoal area

that might interest you.

        As you know, the IRS plans to write the "capacity" of each syncoal

plant into any private letters rulings it issues in the future.  Plant

owners will be held to production at this level.

        I spoke to Joe Makurath this morning about a rumor that he plans to

hold one project that is seeking a ruling to a "capacity" of 198,000 tons a

year.  Makurath is the IRS branch chief for section 29 rulings.  The "rumor"

was actually a report by a tax lawyer for Detroit Edison that the IRS looked

at actual output at his client's plant in 1998 and derived the "capacity" of

the plant from this output.  The tax lawyer complained, but was told he

could "lump it."

        Makurath said the following:

        1. He has made no final decision about how to determine capacity.

        2. The IRS has issued only one ruling since the rulings window

reopened in April.  That was a ruling to someone who already had a ruling,

but who had merely changed the entity that owns the project.  The new ruling

does not specify the capacity of the project.  That's because there was no

change in process from when the earlier ruling was issued.  He regards a

change in feedstock as a change in process.

        3. The "capacity" will be the capacity of the facility when it went

into service in June 1998.

        4. He is still feeling his way on how to determine the capacity when

the facility went into service.  Actual output is merely an "interesting

fact."  Capacity is not the same thing as output.  Some people made

representations about capacity at the time.  It would be "strange" if a

facility that people thought was capable of producing "100 units in June

1998 is now able to produce 1,000 units."  That might call into question

whether the facility was in service in June 1998 because it was just

starting to ramp up.  (An old revenue ruling holds that a power plant was in

service when it was producing at 17% of capacity and ramping up steadily

from there.)

        There was another rumor today that the IRS has backed off somewhat

in the Detroit Edison case.  The taxpayer is hoping it can get a capacity of

two times nameplate.  The coalition of syncoal owners is gearing back up to

lobby Congress for help.

Keith

An Irishman named O'Malley went to his doctor after a long illness.  The doctor, after a lengthy examination, sighed and looked O'Malley in the eye and said, "I've some bad news for you. You have cancer, and it can't be cured, you'd best put your affairs in order."
 
O'Malley was shocked and saddened; but of solid character, he managed to compose himself and walk from the doctor's office into the waiting room. To his son who had been waiting, O'Malley said,  "Well son. We Irish celebrate when things are good, and we celebrate when things don't go so well. In this case, things aren't so well.  I have cancer. Let's head for the pub and have a few pints."
 
After 3 or 4 pints, the two were feeling a little less somber.  There were some laughs and more beers. They were eventually approached by some of O'Malley's old friends who asked what the two were celebrating.
 
O'Malley told them that the Irish celebrate the good and the bad.  He went on to tell them that they were drinking to his impending end.  He told his friends, "I have been diagnosed with AIDS."
 
The friends gave O'Malley their condolences, and they had a couple more beers. After his friends left, O'Malley's son whispered his confusion.
 
"Dad, I thought you said that you were dying from cancer?  You just told your friends that you were dying from AIDS!"
 
O'Malley said, " I don't want any of them sleeping with your mother after I'm gone."

Here is a summary of the structure we are using to buy gas from the gas desk for Harbor.  This is basically what I plan on using for any future tolling deals that come up.  We can always enhance the structure by replacing the Gas Daily with a fixed price or NGI border price.  

Also, can you get me an indicative 5 year offer for PG&E Citygate out of August for 10,000 MMBtu/d?

Thanks!

Attached is a summary of the new gas deal.  Essentially, we will sell selling Gas Daily mid plus $.10 on a variable basis will a cash out on imbalances each month.  This will become effective on June 1 and on a month to month thereafter.  I have added a clause that indicates that EPMI will be assured we will collect our gas costs each month.  Please let me know if these terms do not represent your understanding.

Subject: Entergy -- credits for network upgrades  (ER01-2021 and ER01-2106)
Body: Last week FERC issued an order conditionally accepting two interconnection and operating agreements:  1) Entergy Louisiana and Washington Parish and 2) Entergy Arkansas and GenPower Keo.   The Commission ordered Entergy to revise the credit provision in the agreements (and in Entergy's pro forma IA in its OATT) to provide for crediting of all network upgrades.  This is consistent with a May 2001 FERC order that required Consumers Energy to credit customers for all network upgrade costs, including those incurred to remedy short-circuit or stability related problems.  

If you want more information please let me know.

We have contacted Pat Priestley regarding obtaining the following data for the ISO audit.

We requested two sets of data.  One set which includes daily detail source data from a sample of meters before the application of distribution loss factors and load profiles, and a second set which includes the daily detail meter data that is summed within the SQMD file.  

For each UDC we requested data from 2 meters from each rate class (1 actual meter and 1 estimated meter).  In addition we requested 5 Enron meters from each UDC from different rate classes. The meter data should be taken from 2/15/00, 6/11/00, 7/15/00, 8/7/00, 12/28/00, respectively.

Pat has notified us that a WIP is required in order for us to obtain this data, please confirm if this is the case.

Regards,

Ken

Subject: PG&E GT-NW Receives Open Season Requests Totaling 300-400 MM/d
Body: PG&E GT-NW Plans Lateral Across Washington State 
PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest (GTN) said it received market requests for about three times the capacity on a proposed lateral that would cross Washington and compete with Northwest Pipeline for rapidly expanding power generation markets in the western half of the state along the I-5 highway corridor. GTN closed its open season for the Washington Lateral Project June 22. It was the third open season for a GTN pipeline expansion this year. Meanwhile Northwest Pipeline has four expansions of its own planned for the region. 
"The level of customer interest we received demonstrates the increasing demand for gas in Washington State," said Peter Lund, vice president of the PG&E National Energy Group, which includes GTN. Lund said GTN envisions a pipeline capable of transporting 300,000 to 400,000 Dth/d of gas. GTN said it received expressions of interest from local distributors and power generators. 
The lateral would begin at GTN south of Spokane and head west to the Mid-Columbia area in central Washington, across the Cascades to the I-5 corridor in western Washington, which is served currently by only Northwest Pipeline. The ultimate route for the project has not been determined, and exact delivery points will be determined as the pipeline works out agreements with customers, the company said. "I want you to know that Mount Rainier is in the middle of the route area we are looking at but we will not be going over Mount Rainier because it's a national park; there's no way we are going to do that," said a GTN spokeswoman. "We're basically going to go from east to west over the mountains to I-5." 
The pipeline companies in the Pacific Northwest have worked themselves into an expansion frenzy with two large mainline expansions and this new state-crossing lateral planned by GTN and four large laterals, including a new line to Vancouver Island, planned by Williams' Northwest Pipeline.  The power crisis has been the primary driver. Up until the last few decades, the region has relied on hydroelectricity and wood for its power generation, but now it is turning to natural gas.

***********************************************************************

FUNDAMENTALS AND REGULATIONS CHANGE WESTERN ENERGY OUTLOOKS

Western energy markets are heading into summer with shifts in the fundamental
and regulatory environment. New forces will reduce pressures on prices and
reliability as the power peak builds.

*  The June 19 FERC Order represents a strong dampener of power prices.

*  Energy demand is off considerably on a year-over-year basis.

*  Lower energy demand has contributed to an easing in natural gas prices in
California, but higher summer loads will likely bring higher gas prices.

NLRB AGAIN RULES AGAINST LEE LUMBER BUT DECLINES BARGAINING
ORDER

Lee Lumber and Building Material Corp. illegally withdrew
recognition of an incumbent union before a reasonable time
for bargaining had passed, the National Labor Relations
Board rules in its third decision in the longrunning case,
but this time the board declines to impose an affirmative
bargaining order ("Lee Lumber and Building Material Corp.,
"334 N.L.R.B. No. 62, 6/28/01). On remand from the D.C.
Circuit, the board decides 4-0 "that when an employer has
unlawfully refused to recognize or bargain with an incumbent
union, a reasonable time for bargaining before the union's
majority status can be challenged will be no less than six
months, but no more than one year."

The board says the length of time that would be reasonable
depends on an analysis of several factors--whether the
parties are bargaining for an initial agreement, the
complexity of the issues being negotiated and the parties'
bargaining procedures, the amount of time spent bargaining
and the number of bargaining sessions, the amount of
progress made in negotiations and how near the parties are
to agreement, and the presence or absence of a bargaining
impasse. Applying these factors, the board decides Lee
Lumber did not bargain for a reasonable time before
withdrawing recognition from United Brotherhood of
Carpenters and Joiners Local 1027. . . . Page AA-1,  Text

FULL SEVENTH CIRCUIT SAYS BARGAINING PACT IRRELEVANT TO
LIABILITY

The full Seventh Circuit rules 6-3 to affirm a district
court's decision that evidence regarding an employer's
duties under a collective bargaining agreement was
inadmissible to prove that the company reacted reasonably in
failing to respond promptly to the misdeeds of a "serial
harasser" ("EEOC v. Indiana Bell Tel. Co. Inc. d/b/a
Ameritech Indiana,  "7th Cir. (en banc), No. 99-1155,
6/27/01).

Judge Easterbrook, in a portion of the ruling joined by four
of the judges, rejects Ameritech Indiana's argument that the
evidence is relevant to the issue of liability in sexual
harassment cases brought under Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act and affirms $15,000 in compensatory damages to
three female Ameritech workers. However on a second issue,
Easterbrook, joined by a different line up of five judges,
reverses a $635,000 award in punitive damages against
Ameritech, finding that evidence regarding arbitration and
the collective bargaining agreement was admissible as to the
issue of punitive damages.

Judge Flaum dissents in part, criticizing the majority's
"sweeping dictate" that bargaining agreements are
inadmissible in Title VII cases on the issue of liability.
Judge Rovner dissents on the issue of punitive damages,
arguing that the trial court's refusal to admit the evidence
was harmless  error.  . . . Page A-10,  Text E-7

 JUSTICES WILL REVIEW ERISA PREEMPTION OF EXTERNAL REVIEW IN
HEALTH CARE

Amid heated debate in Congress over a patients' bill of
rights, the Supreme Court decides to rule next term on
whether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act preempts
statutes adopted in at least 37 states requiring external,
independent review of managed care organizations' medical
necessity decisions ("Rush Prudential HMO Inc. v. Moran,
"U.S., No. 00-1021, "cert. granted" 6/29/01).

The high court will review whether Illinois' external review
law is preempted by ERISA or whether it is "saved" from
ERISA preemption because it regulates insurance, an area
traditionally reserved for the states. The case arose after
Eileen Moran tried to recover $94,841 in surgical costs she
had paid after they were denied by Rush Prudential.

In adding the dispute to its 2001-2002 docket, the Supreme
Court opts to rule in a case the Justice Department, in an
amicus brief, had urged the justices not to accept, on
grounds that external review currently is being debated in
Congress.  . . . Page B-1

BNA SURVEY NETS PREDICTIONS OF MODEST ECONOMIC REBOUND

The sharp downturn in the nation's economy during the first
half of 2001 is still not showing any signs of improvement,
yet most economists and policymakers remain confident that
growth will accelerate by the end of the year, according to
BNA's mid-year economic outlook survey.

Among the 24 economists participating in the survey, all but
one believe that growth will rebound by the end of the year
to exceed the first quarter's anemic growth rate of 1.2
percent . Prior to the fourth quarter, however, three of
those economists fully expect to see data showing that the
country had slipped into a mild recession during the second
and third quarters. . . . Page D-1

NO NEW TALKS SCHEDULED IN IBEW DISPUTE WITH CHICAGO ELECTRIC
UTILITY

Two days into a strike by Local 15 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Chicago-based Midwest
Generation Co. has "no timetable" for resuming negotiations
over a new contract covering 1,150 of the electric utility's
employees, a company spokesman says. The strike is "not
about money," he says, but rather language that the union
was attempting to insert in the contract that would restrict
the company's use of outside contractors for work beyond the
scope of normal power plant operations.

Maintaining that the company is misrepresenting its position
in the dispute, Local 15 says no contract language has been
proposed to impede or limit the use of outside contractors.
Midwest Generation, it insists, is refusing to bargain in
good faith. While, the company attributes the strike to a
"union failing to recognize that it no longer works in a
utility environment, but in a competitive marketplace." . .

SUPREME COURT LETS STAND NATIONWIDE ORDER AGAINST BEVERLY
ENTERPRISES

The U.S. Supreme Court lets stand a corporatewide remedial
order imposed by the National Labor Relations Board against
nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises for its widespread
pattern of unfair labor practices ("Beverly Cal. Corp. v.
NLRB, "U.S., No. 00-1563, "cert. denied" 6/29/01). The
Supreme Court denies Beverly's request for review of a
Seventh Circuit ruling substantially upholding the board
decision. The board found the company committed more than
100 unfair labor practices involving 26 nursing homes
nationwide.

The board first issued a corporatewide cease-and-desist
order against Beverly in 1993, but the Second Circuit
overturned it, finding the evidence insufficient for such a
broad remedy. However, the Seventh Circuit in 2000 found
mounting evidence that Beverly "continues to violate the law
with regularity." The board was "entitled to conclude,
especially after specific remedies in [the Second Circuit
case] did not appear to stop the efforts from the company's
central management to stop unions in any way possible, that
the time was past for piecemeal relief," the Seventh Circuit
said. . . . Page B-2,  Text E-1

Subject: Kern River Expansion Completed Ahead of Schedule 
Body: Williams Completes 2001 Kern River Expansion Ahead of Schedule 
SALT LAKE CITY -- A unit of Williams (NYSE: WMB) completed construction of expansion facilities on its Kern River natural gas transmission system on July 1. Williams filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on March 15 for a certificate of approval to proceed with the expansion project, adding 135,000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation service from Wyoming to California.
 "We received FERC approval within three weeks of filing - an unprecedented turnaround. This allowed us to expedite the construction process and bring additional supplies of natural gas to the California market," said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River. "We anticipate most of the new natural gas will go directly to power generation facilities." 
The emergency expansion project added two new compressor stations in Utah and one in California, as well as upgraded compressor units at three existing compressor stations in Wyoming, Utah and Nevada. The installation of these facilities increased the transportation capacity on Kern River by approximately 19 percent. Williams completed the multimillion project more than three weeks ahead of schedule. 
"The extraordinary effort put forth by our contractors, employees and permitting agencies resulted in a successful completion of the project ahead of schedule," stated Micheal Dunn, manager of project management for Kern River. 
With a system that spans the continental United States, Williams' gas pipeline unit is one of the nation's largest-volume transporters of natural gas. The company is based in Houston and has offices in Salt Lake City and Owensboro, Ky. The gas pipeline unit's Kern River Gas Transmission operates a 922-mile system delivering Rocky Mountain and Canadian natural gas to markets in California, Nevada, and Utah. The expanded system has a design capacity of 835 million cubic feet per day.

Body: Michael, Jan Cooley is compiling a list of inhouse lawyers who have been employed at EES or EWS since 1999.

Subject:	Status report regarding subpenas

This summarizes the status of our work in response to the subpoenas served
on Enron Corp by Dunn's committee and on EES by the AG.

	Today's meeting with Dave Parquet: Amanda Smith and I met with Dave
Parquet at the Enron Corp offices in San Francisco late this afternoon and
then talked with him this evening. He generally described the documents in
the office. He describes most as confidential or proprietary. He will
assemble the team leaders in the office and meet with Amanda and me and two
other associates Monday morning. We should be able to complete a snapshot of
the documents in the office by mid Tuesday. Our discussions raised the
following issues:

	. Dave said Enron has a small generating subsidiary located near
Palm Springs, Enron Wind Energy. It generates and sells power to utilities.
The Enron subpoena asks for generation data. We will contact them Monday by
phone.

	.EES has a small office in Long Beach. Amanda will talk to their
employees Monday.

	. A Master Limited Partnership, EOTT Energy, also has an office in
Long Beach. They may be a subsidiary of Enron Corp. Please let us know if we
should contact him.

	. Many documents in San Francisco are covered by confidentiality
agreements with Enron's clients. Dave said the confidentiality of these
documents are not clear on their face and we should involve an Enron
attorney in Portland -he suggested Karen Jones- to work on this issue with
us.


	Document Retention: David said he is concerned that there is no
clear corporate guideline for e-mail retention in his office. We should send
him and the directors in that office (as well as all EES directors)  a clear
directive as soon as possible. For the time being he is following oral
instructions not to delete e-mail or other documents. Earlier, Amanda talked
the EES IT manager, who said that it is not possible to automatically save
e-mail from most EES personnel in California (those who are on the legacy
e-mail system). Until we solve this problem I suggest we retain the daily
back-up tapes made  for the legacy system (just as we are doing for our
Portland office).

	Telephone call with AG's office  regarding the EES subpoena: This
afternoon I talked to Hirem Pattel, a deputy AG who is temporarily in charge
of the EES investigation. I told him we would produce some documents without
waiving our objections, but needed to discuss any production with him
beforehand. I repeated Bob's offer to meet next Friday. He said they would
not meet with us until we again responded to the subpoena and said in
writing we would produce documents. I told him we had no obligation to do
that and wanted to meet with them first. He then said he would have his
supervisor call me early next week.

	Directives to California officers: All the EES and Enron people we
have talked with in the past two weeks have been cooperative. Given the time
crunch, however, it would be helpful if an Enron lawyer could contact
California officers and ask them to make special efforts to help us with the
document review. The people to contact are Messrs. Reilly, Parquet;McDonald,
Mara,Wright, van Ulden, and the head of the Enron Wind Energy Office.

	Review of EES documents at San Ramon: Amanda Smith spent the morning
today there and gathered documents underlying the UC litigation. Lockyer
knows this litigation and will probably use our positions in it to gauge our
compliance with any production agreement. We will complete an assessment of
these documents early next week.  We also found and took custody of the
backup tape made in San Ramon May 25. Apparently no similar tape exists for
Costa Mesa. We will identify and obtain earliest back-up tape that exists at
that office.

	As we review documents for privilege we should know the identity of
all Enron lawyers. Bob, could someone in your office act as a contact person
to supply us with this and similar information?
